# imc_prosperity

In here I got the code I wrote for imc prosperity3 for the first round and some other ideas which might be useful for future trading competitions. I also add some functions where I simply have the trading logic implemented.

In round 1, our team was ranked 19, but a few of the contestants in front of us were reset to 0 points due to hardcoding their answers.

For cubic_atm_spline.py I just wanted to test, if we interpolate the implied volatilities for the different strikes to estimate the implied vol. ATM at each time step, if we could find a pattern for it, which we could use for a trading strategy, it didn't work too well.
